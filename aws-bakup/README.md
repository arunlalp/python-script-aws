To enable automatic backups for an Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) file system, you can use AWS Backup to automate and manage backups across AWS services. Hereâ€™s how to do it using AWS CLI:

### Step 1: Create a Backup Plan

First, you need to create a backup plan that specifies when and how often to back up your EFS file system.

1. **Create a Backup Plan JSON file:**
   Create a file named `backup-plan.json` with the following content:

   ```json
   {
       "BackupPlanName": "EFSBackupPlan",
       "Rules": [
           {
               "RuleName": "DailyBackup",
               "TargetBackupVaultName": "Default",
               "ScheduleExpression": "cron(0 12 * * ? *)",
               "StartWindowMinutes": 60,
               "CompletionWindowMinutes": 180,
               "Lifecycle": {
                   "DeleteAfterDays": 30
               }
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   This plan creates daily backups at 12:00 UTC and retains them for 30 days.

2. **Create the Backup Plan:**

   ```sh
   aws backup create-backup-plan --backup-plan file://backup-plan.json
   ```

### Step 2: Assign Resources to the Backup Plan

Next, you need to assign your EFS file system to the backup plan.

1. **Get the EFS File System ARN:**

   ```sh
   aws efs describe-file-systems --query "FileSystems[*].FileSystemId" --output text
   ```

2. **Create a JSON file to specify the resource assignment:**
   Create a file named `resource-assignment.json` with the following content, replacing `your-file-system-id` with the actual File System ID:

   ```json
   {
       "BackupPlanId": "your-backup-plan-id",
       "BackupSelection": {
           "SelectionName": "EFSBackupSelection",
           "IamRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::your-account-id:role/service-role/AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole",
           "Resources": [
               "arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:region:account-id:file-system/your-file-system-id"
           ]
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Assign the Resource to the Backup Plan:**

   ```sh
   aws backup create-backup-selection --cli-input-json file://resource-assignment.json
   ```

Replace `your-backup-plan-id`, `your-account-id`, `region`, and `your-file-system-id` with your actual AWS Backup Plan ID, AWS Account ID, AWS region, and EFS File System ID respectively.

### Step 3: Verify the Backup Plan and Selection

You can verify that your backup plan and selection have been created successfully by running:

```sh
aws backup list-backup-plans
aws backup list-backup-selections --backup-plan-id your-backup-plan-id
```

This setup will ensure that your EFS file system is backed up automatically according to the specified schedule in the backup plan.
